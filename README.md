Repositories with solved tasks.

## Tasks

1. Some company, when transmitting data over the phone, is concerned that the phones may be tapped. All data is transmitted as four-digit integers. Write a program in JavaScript using a function that encrypts this data. The script reads a four-digit number in the prompt window and encrypts it as follows: each digit is replaced by the sum of the digit with the number 7 in the remainder when divided by 10. Then the first digit is swapped with the third and the second with the fourth. Print the resulting code.

2. Create an html form containing 3 input fields to enter the 3 sides of the triangle, a "Calculate" button and input fields to output the results. Create a *.js file containing functions that calculate the perimeter, area, and view of the triangle based on its sides. Using CSS styles, apply the design to the page.

3. Write a distanta function that calculates the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). All values must be of real type. You will need the Math.sqrt function to calculate the square root. Use this function in a script that allows the user to enter the coordinates of the points into an HTML form and outputs the result in the same form.

4. Create the html form shown in the figure. When the user clicks on the "Total" button, calculate the total sum of all field values. Create a *.js file containing a function that calculates the total. Using CSS styles, apply the design to the page.
